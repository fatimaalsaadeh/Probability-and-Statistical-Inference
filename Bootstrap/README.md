–Build a bias, standard deviation, and  confidence interval estimator for the mean based on the bootstrap (use 10000 =nboot) and the jackknife

–Build a simulator that draws n samples form a lognormal distribution (rlnorm) and builds both the central limit theorem based confidence interval, and compares it to the coverage rate for the 3 bootstrap and the jacknife normal based confidence interval (with bias correction (how would you do that)) (confidence interval based on the 1st program). (1000 simulation runs minimum)

Normal approximation
Pivotal CI
–Compare the coverage rates for the bootstrap confidence interval, the jacknife normal approximation confidence interval and the central limit theorem based confidence interval. For sample sizes 10, 30, and 100 alpha=0.05 (95% confidence)

–For the standard deviation of the normal distribution, estimate the bias of the the sample standard deviation when dividing by n, compare the bootstrap and the jacknife (1000 simulations).
